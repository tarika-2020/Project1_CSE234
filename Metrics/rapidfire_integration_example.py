"""Drop-in compute_metrics_fn and accumulate_metrics_fn for Project 1.

Uses project1_eval so scores match evaluate_retrieval.py and run_judge.py.

Your preprocess/postprocess must populate these batch fields:
    retrieved_spans      list of lists of (file, start, end) tuples per query, in rank order
    serialized_context   list of str per query: the text passed to the generator
    ground_truth_spans   list of lists of (file, start, end) tuples per query
    reference_answer     list of str per query

The official judge for this project is `claude-sonnet-4-6-aws` on the TritonAI
gateway. Configure via env vars before experiment.run_evals():
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<TritonAI key from api-key.txt>"
    os.environ["JUDGE_BASE_URL"] = "https://tritonai-api.ucsd.edu/v1"
    os.environ["JUDGE_MODEL"]    = "claude-sonnet-4-6-aws"

See https://tritonai-api.ucsd.edu/ui/model_hub_table/ for available models.
